# Controller to Mouse
Controller to Mouse is a simple tool designed to use avoid using your mouse when you are already using a controller.
This tool doesn't need to be installed, just run the executable file to start it. If you found this shit useful, recommend it to other people! 

## How to Use
Open the file inside the 'executable' folder. Once you receive a notification saying "Device Connected Successfully" you are ready to use your controller as a mouse! Once you start this application it executes as a background activity. To close this application simply unplug your device and click the "Exit Application" button on the notification.
