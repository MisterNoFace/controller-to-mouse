# Controller to Mouse
Controller to Mouse is a simple tool designed to use avoid using your mouse when you are already using a controller.
This tool doesn't need to be installed, just run the executable file to start it. If you found this shit useful, recommend it to other people! 

## How to Use
Open the file inside the 'executable' folder. Once you receive a notification saying "Device Connected Successfully" you are ready to use your controller as a mouse! Once you start this application it executes as a background activity. To close this application simply unplug your device and click the "Exit Application" button on the notification.

### Controls

Mouse Controls:
- use the LEFT ring to move the mouse
- use the RIGHT ring to scroll up and down
- press the A button to left click or select
- hold the X button to slow down the mouse movement (to be more precise when moving it)
- press the B button to right click
- press the Xbox button to pause or unpause this tool

Note that when this tool is paused, the Controller still works as usual, but it won't affect the mouse cursor. When you unplug a device, this tool will pause automatically and if you plug in a device it will unpause automatically. In both cases, you will receive a nofitication if everything goes shoothly.

### Autoload
The autoload feature, if enabled, activates this tool automatically every time you turn on your pc. It can be enabled or disabled when you plug in your device, just by clicking the "Enable/Disable Autoload on startup" button on the notification.
